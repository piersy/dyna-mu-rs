so instead of filtering the annotations list and then applying some function based on the kind of filtering we do
eg filter to find Produces and then apply the produces we could instead iterate annotations and look them up in a map
and then execute the function associated with that annotation (really the map would need to be a class that uses
isAssignableFrom) but this seems more flexible, it also removes the repetition of filtering in each sub function.

There would be 2 phases for this

1. Static for annotations applied to the method
2. Dynamic for annotations applied to the method parameters

In fact we could do this approach just for the dynamic for now, since it has not been done
and stick with the current for static stuff.

Problem with the above is you cannot map an annotation easily, an annotation by definition has a class of annotation . . .
Ah fixed the annotationType method returns the actual class allowing for easy mapping of annotation to its static type

In terms of making this more flexible I could define my own builder interface that is manipulated by the configuration
functions, different implementations could then be supplied to perform the request execution process with an arbitrary client

Since jax-rs provides the fromString static function to generate CookieParam annotated types and HeaderParamAnnotated types
from string, i will need to provide the same but converse,
Options are use toString - dodge
implement interface Cookieable provides method toCookieString - safer
provide a static method to do the above
provide a configuring method that contains the to string logic
